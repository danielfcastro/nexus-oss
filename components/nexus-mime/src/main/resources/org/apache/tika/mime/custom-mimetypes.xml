    HACK: Using higher priority than default (which is 40) due to problem with type="text/html" configuration
    which is also at the same priority (40) and is causing uncompressed zips with html-entries to be detected
    as text/html instead of as zip or sub-types (ie jars).
    Recorded to Tika project as issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-1292
